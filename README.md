# Bitcoin Price Prediction
Machine Learning program using SVR, XGBoost, LSTM and SGD Regressor

***
### Introduction:
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Over the past decade, it has gained significant popularity, and its value has seen massive fluctuations. Predicting the future price of Bitcoin is of great interest to investors, traders, and researchers. This project aims to build a machine-learning model that can predict the future price of Bitcoin.

### Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the future price of Bitcoin that includes:
-	Collecting and cleaning historical data on the price of Bitcoin and relevant market factors.
-	Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and relationships.
-	Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithms to develop the prediction model.
-	Evaluating the performance of the model and fine-tuning it as needed.

### Methods: 
The following methods will be used to achieve the project objectives:
-	Data Collection: Historical data on the price of Bitcoin and relevant market factors will be obtained from reliable sources such as coinmarketcap.com, http://blockchain.com/, and other reliable sources.
-	Data Cleaning: The collected data will be preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant values and to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
-	Feature(attribute) Selection: Based on the data analysis, the most relevant features will be selected for the model building process.
-	Model Building: A combination of machine learning algorithms, including time-series, and deep learning, will be used to build the model. The model will be trained on the historical data and tested on unseen data.
-	Model Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance will be evaluated using appropriate techniques. Based on the results, the model will be improved as needed. 

### Expected Outcomes:
A model that predicts the future price of Bitcoin with a high degree of accuracy. A comprehensive report on the results and evaluation of the model.
Conclusion: The proposed project aims to address the challenge of predicting the future price of Bitcoin by developing a machine learning model based on historical data and other relevant information.

Team Members and Responsibilities:

Farid Koushaneh: Data collection and cleaning, Data Analysis, Model selection and development, Model evaluation and fine-tuning.

Eliot Pardo: Data Analysis, Model selection, Model evaluation, create reports on the result.
Note: The responsibilities of the team members can be adjusted. The goal is to build a model by working as a team. We will work on each part together to ensure the project is successful.
